## Our Goal - Very High Accuracy on MRI Classification of AD

Since clinical diagnosis of AD has its problems (as seen above), we wanted to see if there is a
way to get very high accuracies for detection of AD and its different stages. 

We were able to do so by applying Deep Learning techniques on a dataset of MRI images of patients' brains.

Our best model achieved an accuracy of 99.53% (using pretrained Inception-V3 weights).

In our project, we focused only on AD prediction and classified patients into 4 different
stages: 

Non Demented, Very Mild Demented, Mild Demented and Moderate Demented.
